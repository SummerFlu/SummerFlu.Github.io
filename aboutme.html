            <header>Uses of Statistics in my interest</header>
            <p>This video of statistics gives a basic idea on the expectations and different ways statistics can affect our everyday life. This video is quite short but it keeps the topic interesting and is able to be a good introduction to the topic. I watched this video when I first started this course in order to learn more about the topic at hand. I enjoyed this video because I liked how accessible the video made statstics sound and some general ideas I would be using during the course. After watching, I felt not only prepared but also even more interested in the various topics that I could delve into. </p>
            <p>I am finding that there are many applications and interesting aspects of statistics. It is helpful to learn about the real-world uses of statistics because it motivates me to engage with the subject. I am constantly impressed by all the different ways statistics can be used and be applied to our normal lives. I am excited to  see what is in store for the future. I always connsidered statistics a subject of math that has many limitations and wont be aplicable to my life. I was very  wrong and seeing it appplied to useful manners  makes me more excited to learn more.
