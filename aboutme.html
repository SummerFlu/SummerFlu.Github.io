            <header>Uses of Statistics in my interest</header>
            <p>This video of statistics gives a basic idea on the expectations and different ways statistics can affect our everyday life. This video is quite short but it keeps the topic interesting and is able to be a good introduction to the topic. I watched this video when I first started this course in order to learn more about the topic at hand. Data is something that many people may not think much of but there are ways that we can use that information in order to see things more clearer. </p>
            <p>I am finding that there are many applications and interesting aspects of statistics. It is helpful to learn about the real-world uses of statistics because it motivates me to engage with the subject. I am constantly impressed by all the different ways statistics can be used and be applied to our normal lives. I am excited to  see what is in store for the future.
