            <p> The field of statistics is concerned with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. As technology becomes more present in our daily lives, more data is being generated and collected than ever before in human history. Statistics is the field that can help us understand how to use this data to gain a better understanding of the world around us, make decisions using data, and make predictions about the future using data. My entire view of statistics has drastically shifted as I delved deeper and deepper into the subject. Seeing the complexity and the multitude of uses statistics really opened my eyes on the usefulness it can have. From predicting outcomes to analyzing large amounts of data, there are many applications I could use statistics. This article exemplifies the broad capabilities and the importance of the subject.   </p>
