        <p>The trend of aging women who have children has been increasing in recent years. More and more women are choosing to have children later in life, often in their 30s or 40s. This trend is likely due to a number of factors, including women pursuing higher education and careers before starting families, increased access to fertility treatments, and improved health care for pregnant women and their babies. The result of this trend is that older mothers are becoming more common, and many women are successfully giving birth and raising healthy children at an older age. Despite some potential challenges and risks, many women are choosing to have children later in life and are finding it to be a rewarding and fulfilling experience. </p>
    <p>I enjoy this lab because of the importance of the data and how it affects our normal lives. The results can be seen in the data and has given me a better understanding distribution and analyzing data </p>
